=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckosmowski/doby-grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckosmowski/doby-grid) [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2018.svg)]()

Doby Grid is a Javascript module for rendering a dynamic, data-driven grid. It's basically a `<table>` element on steroids.

---

This is a fork of https://github.com/EvNaverniouk/doby-grid. The goal of this project is to keep the doby-grid component alive and to develop it towards current browsers and to remove dependencies only used for old browsers.

---

### Installation

For now: see "Development"
After grunt build successfully finished you will have a doby-grid.js file inside the "build" folder.

### Development

To build the project from the source code (and to look at the packaged examples) you'll need to clone the repo and then run:

```
npm install
grunt build
```
